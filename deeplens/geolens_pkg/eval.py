"""Classical optical performance evaluation for geometric lens systems.

This module provides a mixin class ``GeoLensEval`` that adds Zemax-equivalent
optical evaluation capabilities to ``GeoLens``.  Spot, distortion and
vignetting metrics are computed purely by geometric ray tracing: rays are
sampled from object space, propagated through all lens surfaces (refraction +
clipping), and analyzed at the sensor plane.  ``mtf`` goes through ``psf()``,
so it follows whichever PSF model that dispatches to, and ``analysis_rendering``
reports PSNR/SSIM from a rendered image.

Coordinate convention (shared with the rest of DeepLens):
    - **z-axis**: optical axis, light travels in +z direction.
    - **y-axis**: meridional (tangential) plane.
    - **x-axis**: sagittal plane.
    - Sensor plane is at ``z = self.d_sensor``.

Key dependencies consumed from the parent ``GeoLens`` instance:
    - ``self.sample_radial_rays()``, ``self.sample_grid_rays()``: ray sampling.
    - ``self.trace(ray)``, ``self.trace2sensor(ray)``: sequential ray tracing.
    - ``self.psf()``, ``self.psf_rgb()``: point-spread-function computation.
    - ``self.render()``: image-plane rendering via ray tracing or PSF convolution.
    - ``self.d_sensor``, ``self.sensor_size``, ``self.pixel_size``, ``self.rfov``,
      ``self.foclen``, ``self.device``: lens geometry attributes.

Functions:
    Spot Diagram:
        spot_points: Core ray-tracing function — samples rays from physical
            object points, traces through the lens, returns sensor positions.
            Shared by draw_spot_radial, draw_spot_map, and rms_map.
        draw_spot_radial: Spot diagrams at evenly-spaced field angles along a
            chosen direction (meridional/sagittal/diagonal), with RGB overlay.
        draw_spot_map: 2-D grid of spot diagrams across the full field of view.

    RMS Spot Error:
        rms_map_rgb: Per-pixel RMS spot radius for R/G/B, referenced to the
            green-channel centroid (chromatic shift included).
        rms_map: Per-pixel RMS spot radius for a single wavelength, referenced
            to its own centroid.

    Distortion:
        calc_distortion_radial: Fractional distortion at evenly-spaced field
            angles along the meridional direction
        draw_distortion_radial: Distortion-vs-field-angle curve (Zemax style).
        calc_distortion_map: 2-D grid of actual-vs-ideal image positions.
        calc_inv_distortion_map: Inverse grid for applying distortion with
            ``grid_sample``.
        draw_distortion_map: Scatter plot of the distortion grid.
        distortion_center: Normalized chief-ray image positions for arbitrary
            object points (used for warp/unwarp).

    MTF (Modulation Transfer Function):
        mtf: Geometric MTF (tangential + sagittal) at a single field position
            via PSF → FFT.
        psf2mtf: Static utility converting a 2-D PSF array to tangential and
            sagittal MTF curves.
        draw_mtf: Grid of tangential MTF curves for multiple depths, FOVs, and
            RGB wavelengths.

    Vignetting:
        vignetting: Fractional ray-throughput map across the field.
        draw_vignetting: Grayscale image of relative illumination.

    Chief Ray:
        calc_chief_ray: Extract the real sampled ray closest to the physical
            aperture-stop centre — from object points (finite conjugates),
            field angles (infinite conjugates), or a traced bundle.

    Comprehensive Analysis:
        analysis_spot: RMS and geometric spot radii averaged over RGB at
            multiple field positions.
        analysis_rendering: Render a test image through the lens and report
            PSNR / SSIM.
        analysis: One-call entry point that chains layout drawing, spot
            analysis, and (optionally) full evaluation + rendering.

class GeoLensEval:
    """Mixin that adds classical optical evaluation methods to ``GeoLens``.

    This class is **never instantiated on its own**.  It is mixed into
    ``GeoLens`` via multiple inheritance, so every method can access lens
    geometry (``self.d_sensor``, ``self.rfov``, …) and ray-tracing routines
    (``self.trace()``, ``self.trace2sensor()``, …) directly through ``self``.

    All evaluation functions follow the same pattern:
        1. Sample rays from object space (parallel / grid / radial).
        2. Trace rays through the lens (``self.trace`` or ``self.trace2sensor``).
        3. Analyze ray positions / directions at the sensor plane.
        4. Optionally produce a matplotlib figure saved to disk.

    Results are accuracy-aligned with Zemax OpticStudio for the same lens
    prescriptions and ray-sampling densities.

    Attributes consumed from ``GeoLens`` (via ``self``):
        d_sensor (float): Axial position of the sensor plane (mm).
        sensor_size (tuple[float, float]): Sensor (width, height) in mm.

        """Calculate one real, physical-stop-centred chief ray per field.

        DeepLens uses the classical physical definition: the chief ray is the
        real ray through the centre of the aperture stop. Because the tracer
        samples a finite bundle, this method returns the sampled ray closest to
        the stop centre rather than a synthetic bundle centroid. The selection
        residual scales as ``~1/sqrt(num_rays)`` of the stop radius; raise
        ``num_rays`` when tighter stop centring is needed (e.g. relative
        distortion at small field angles, where the residual is amplified by
        the small ideal image height).

        Exactly one input mode must be supplied:

        1. ``points_obj`` samples and traces rays from object-space points to
           the sensor before extracting the chief ray (finite conjugates).
        2. ``fov`` traces a collimated bundle at the given field angles
           (infinite conjugates) in the ``plane`` direction.
        3. ``ray`` extracts from an already traced bundle that crossed the
           aperture stop, avoiding duplicate tracing.

        Selection happens before final validity is checked. If the closest
        stop-centred ray is clipped after the stop, it remains the selected ray
        and is returned as invalid rather than being replaced by a farther ray.
        The result's ``stop_dist`` is its distance from the stop centre in
        stop radii. If no sample has a finite recorded distance, including an
        untraced bundle, the result is invalid with ``stop_dist=inf``. Multiply
        a recorded distance by the stop radius used for tracing to obtain
        the distance in millimetres.

        Args:
            points_obj (torch.Tensor | list | None): Physical object points in
                millimetres, shape ``[..., 3]``.
            ray (Ray | None): Already traced ray bundle that crossed the
                aperture stop, shape ``[..., num_rays, 3]``.
            fov (float | list | torch.Tensor | None): Field angle(s) in
                degrees for infinite-conjugate chief rays, shape ``[N]`` (a
                scalar becomes ``[1]``).
            plane (str): ``'meridional'`` (y-axis) or ``'sagittal'`` (x-axis);
                used by ``fov`` mode only. Defaults to ``'meridional'``.
            num_rays (int): Samples per field in ``points_obj`` / ``fov``
                mode. Defaults to ``SPP_CALC``.
            wvln (float | None): Wavelength in micrometres for the sampling
                modes. Defaults to the lens primary wavelength.
            scale_pupil (float): Entrance-pupil sampling-radius multiplier in
                the sampling modes. Defaults to 1.0.
            record (bool): Return ``(chief_ray, path)`` with a singleton ray
                dimension in every path entry. Not valid in ``ray`` mode.

        Returns:
            Ray | tuple[Ray, list[torch.Tensor]]: One selected chief ray per
            field, with shape ``[..., 1, 3]``, and optionally its traced path.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the input modes are invalid, sampling parameters are
                invalid, the supplied bundle is empty, or path
                recording is requested for a supplied bundle.
            TypeError: If ``ray`` is not a :class:`Ray`.

        Vignetting measures how much light is lost at each field position due to

        A value of 1.0 means all rays reach the sensor (no vignetting); 0.0

        This is the main entry point for evaluating a lens design.  It chains
        multiple evaluation steps in order, saving all plots with a common
        ``save_name`` prefix.

        Execution flow:
            1. **Always**: draw the lens layout (``draw_layout``) and compute
               polychromatic spot RMS/radius (``analysis_spot``).
            2. **If** ``full_eval=True``: additionally generate:
               - Spot diagram (``draw_spot_radial``).
               - MTF grid (``draw_mtf``).
               - Distortion curve (``draw_distortion_radial``).
               - Vignetting map (``draw_vignetting``).
            3. **If** ``render=True``: render a test chart image through the
               lens and report PSNR/SSIM (``analysis_rendering``).

        Args:
            save_name (str): Path prefix for all output files.  Each plot
                appends a suffix (e.g., ``'_spot.png'``, ``'_mtf.png'``).
                Defaults to ``'./lens'``.
            depth (float): Object distance in mm.  ``float('inf')`` is replaced
                by ``self.obj_depth`` for rendering and vignetting.
                Defaults to ``float('inf')``.
            full_eval (bool): If ``True``, run all evaluation plots.  If
                ``False``, only layout + spot RMS. Defaults to ``False``.
            render (bool): If ``True``, render a test image through the lens.
                Defaults to ``False``.
            render_unwarp (bool): If ``True`` (and ``render=True``), also
                produce an unwarped rendering. Defaults to ``False``.
            lens_title (str | None): Title string for the layout plot.
                Defaults to ``None``.
            show (bool): If ``True``, display all plots interactively.
                Defaults to ``False``.
