    Predicts PSFs as flattened vectors using stacked linear layers with ReLU

        in_features (int): Number of input features (e.g., field angle + wavelength).
        out_features (int): Number of output features (flattened PSF size).
        hidden_features (int): Width of hidden layers. Defaults to 64.
