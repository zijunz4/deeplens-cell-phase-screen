# DeepLens

DeepLens is a differentiable optical lens simulator for computational imaging, supporting multiple optical models (e.g., ray tracing, wave propagation, ray-wave model, surrogate PSF network). DeepLens can be used for (1) end-to-end optics-algorithm co-design, (2) automated optical design, and (3) image simulation for synthetic datasets.

DeepLens helps researchers and engineers rapidly prototype and design custom optical systems. DeepLens is also **AI-native**: ask your agent to call DeepLens directly, so that its optical reasoning is grounded in real simulation, for example, `use DeepLens to compute the MTF of this lens`.

## News

- **08/14/2025**: DeepLens joins OpenAI's "Codex for Open Source". We will build AI-native optical simulation and design tools.
- **08/09/2025**: We released [DeepO](https://ai4optics.com/deepo/), an AI optical design platform.

## Why DeepLens

Commercial optical design software (Zemax, Code V, etc.) is built for a human designer clicking through a GUI. DeepLens is built for optics that lives inside a PyTorch training loop, where the lens is a set of learnable parameters optimized jointly with a neural network, and gradients flow through the optics.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Gradients**          | Analytic, via autograd                      | Finite differences         |
| **Python**             | Native (tensors in, tensors out)            | External API bridge        |
| **Hardware**           | GPU (CUDA / ROCm), batched                  | Mostly CPU-bound           |
| **End-to-end co-design** | Optics + ISP + network in one graph        | Not supported              |
| **Agent-scriptable**   | Plain Python, no GUI in the loop            | GUI-centric                |
| **License**            | Free, Apache-2.0                            | Commercial                 |

## Applications

#### 1. Lens Analysis and Image Simulation

DeepLens supports comprehensive lens analysis (spot diagram, PSF, MTF, distortion, etc.) and photorealistic image simulation with spatially varying, depth-dependent aberrations.

</div>

#### 2. Automated Geometric Lens Design

Fully automated lens design from scratch with gradient-based optimization and advanced optimization algorithms.

> **Note:** Automated lens design is now actively maintained in the [**AutoLens**](https://github.com/AI4Optics/AutoLens) project. If your focus is automated lens design, we recommend using the AutoLens repo instead, as it receives dedicated updates and improvements for this use case.

#### 5. Non-Sequential Model and Polarization Tracing

Non-sequential polarization tracing to accurately simulate the polarization state of light passing through a geometric waveguide AR display. End-to-end optimization for coating film inverse design targeting the out-coupling eyebox response.

#### 6. End-to-End Computational Imaging

DeepLens serves as the differentiable optics engine in [**End2endImaging**](https://github.com/vccimaging/End2endImaging), an end-to-end differentiable computational imaging framework. End2endImaging integrates optics, sensor/ISP simulation, and neural reconstruction networks into a single PyTorch computation graph, enabling joint optimization of the entire camera pipeline.
