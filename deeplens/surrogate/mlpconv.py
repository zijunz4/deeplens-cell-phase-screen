class MLPConv(nn.Module):
    """MLP encoder plus convolutional decoder for high-resolution PSF prediction.

    The MLP encoder maps the input features to a low-resolution feature map of
    spatial size `min(ks, 32)`, which a transposed-convolution decoder then
    upsamples by powers of two to the target PSF size `ks`. The decoder output is
    always Sigmoid-activated and L1-normalized over the two spatial dimensions so
    each predicted PSF sums to one.

    Reference:
        "Differentiable Compound Optics and Processing Pipeline Optimization for
        End-To-end Camera Design".

    Attributes:
        ks (int): Spatial size of the output PSF.
        ks_mlp (int): Spatial size of the MLP feature map, `min(ks, 32)`.
        channels (int): Number of output channels.
        encoder (nn.Sequential): Linear encoder producing the feature map.
        decoder (nn.Sequential): Transposed-convolution upsampling decoder.
        activation (nn.Module): Activation module selected by `activation`. Note
            that the forward pass uses a Sigmoid regardless of this attribute.

    Args:
        in_features (int): Number of input features (e.g. field angle plus wavelength).
        ks (int): Spatial size of the output PSF. When greater than 32 it must be a
            multiple of 32 (asserted), and in practice $32 \\cdot 2^n$ so the decoder
            upsamples by integer powers of two.
        channels (int, optional): Number of output channels. Defaults to 3.
        activation (str, optional): Activation name, `"relu"` or `"sigmoid"`, stored
            on `self.activation` but unused by `forward`. Defaults to `"relu"`.
