"""Defocus lens model based on the circle-of-confusion (CoC) PSF.

This lens simulates defocus blur (depth of field) by pre-computing the
circle-of-confusion PSF and applying it directly, instead of tracing rays. The
CoC PSF is derived from paraxial optics: given the focal length, F-number and
focus distance, the circle-of-confusion diameter at each object depth follows
the paraxial defocus relation, and the resulting blur disk is used as the PSF.
This CoC formulation is the standard approach for defocus simulation, both in
the literature and in software such as Blender. It captures defocus but not
higher-order optical aberrations.

Unique to this model, DefocusLens can also generate dual-pixel (DP) PSFs -- the
left/right sub-aperture views recorded by dual-pixel sensors -- via `psf_dp`,
`psf_rgb_dp`, `psf_map_dp` and `render_rgbd_dp`, which are useful for
defocus- and depth-estimation research.

            rgb_img (torch.Tensor): RGB object image, shape [B, 3, H, W].
            depth (torch.Tensor): Depth map in [mm], shape [B, 1, H, W].
            psf_ks (int, optional): PSF kernel size in pixels. Defaults to PSF_KS.
            num_layers (int, optional): Number of depth layers. Defaults to 16.

        Returns:
            img_left (torch.Tensor): Left sub-aperture image, shape [B, 3, H, W].
            img_right (torch.Tensor): Right sub-aperture image, shape [B, 3, H, W].
