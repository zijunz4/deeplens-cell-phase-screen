    A folding prism for sequential ray tracing. A ray refracts through the entry
    plane, reflects off the internal mirror, then refracts out through the exit
    plane. The prism local coordinate frame coincides with that of the entry plane.

    Attributes:
        mirror_angle (torch.Tensor): Mirror tilt angle in radians (scalar),
            converted from the degrees passed to `__init__`.
        plane1 (Plane): Entry plane whose `d_next` reaches the internal mirror.
        mirror (Mirror): Internal mirror at prism-local axial offset
            $r\\tan(\\text{mirror\\_angle})$ [mm].
        exit_plane (Plane): Exit plane, sharing the mirror's prism-local vertex.
        surfaces (list): The three sub-surfaces in trace order
            `[plane1, mirror, exit_plane]`.
